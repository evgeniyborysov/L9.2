                        <h3>Where am I going? How long have I got?</h3>
                        <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams
                            glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... 
                            <i>Time to die.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
                            just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
                        </p>
